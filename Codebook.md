# Codebook for tidydataset.csv
## Rudy Pastel

The tidy data set tidydataset.csv is the processed version data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. More information on this data set, the experiment, the meaning of variables and the processing method is given in the README.md file.

tidydataset.csv lists average values identified by the name of the averaged measurement, the activity done at measurement time and the subject performing the activity.
The tidy data set therefore has four variables.
- "measurement" : name of the measured quantity, a character string.
- "activity" : name the activity done at measurement time, a character string
- "subject" : identification number of the person performing the activity, a character string
- "average" : average value of the name measurement, a unitless number in [-1,1] just as the original measurements.
